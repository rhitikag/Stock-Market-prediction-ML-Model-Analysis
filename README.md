# Stock-Market-prediction-ML-Model-Analysis
An experimental analysis of large-scale stock market data using various machine learning models, comparing their predictive performance against the ARIMA time series model. This project documents model failures, insights, and key learnings from applying ML to noisy financial data.

## üìâ Failed Models Stock Prediction

This project explores **large-scale stock market data analysis** using various **machine learning models**, comparing their predictive performance against the classic **ARIMA** time series model.  
The goal is to understand how different models behave on noisy, real-world financial data ‚Äî including what *didn‚Äôt* work and why.

## üß† Project Overview

Stock price prediction is notoriously difficult due to market volatility, randomness, and non-stationarity.  
In this notebook, multiple machine learning approaches are tested and compared against ARIMA, including:

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- and other baseline models

The notebook highlights model limitations, failure cases, and insights for future tuning or hybrid modeling.
